The purpose of this project is to utilize the API of Capital One bank and make effective use of it. In our case, we used it retrieve the geolocation data of merchants as well as the banks in the database. We used Google map’s API in conjunction with Capital One’s in order to create a map with all the hotspots of retail demand. Our goal is to visually represent the locations of both the merchants as well as the location of banks on the map in order to easily pinpoint hotspots of demand. The idea is to use these analytics to easily predict the most profitable locations when constructing new banks.
